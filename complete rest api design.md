API design is something that as a backend engineer you will spend a lot of
0:05
time working on and thinking about and it is one of the most important videos
0:11
in this playlist and in this video we are going to talk a lot about uh
0:17
designing apis a lot of Concepts surrounding uh apis in general and we'll
0:23
be mostly focusing on rest API there are different technologies that people use
0:29
to build API uh we have RPC calls and we have graphql
0:36
etc etc so in this one we are going to only focus on rest API one of the most
0:42
used API standards now the problem with API design is we have all these
0:49
resources and we also have this common standard which is called a rest API or
0:55
restful API standard and years of research and many many developers
1:00
particularly backend Engineers experience over the years and but still
1:05
even now when someone who is learning backend or in the early stages of their
1:12
journey into backend engineering they still get confused by certain questions
1:17
questions like should the URI path segment be plural or singular or when
1:23
updating a resource should you call patch or should you call put right
1:28
different different http methods and also if it's a non- crud operation
1:34
meaning if it's not a fetch operation or create operation or an update operation or a delete operation it's it's a custom
1:42
action something that you want the server to perform it's called an action
1:47
call so which method should you use since it it sounds like update should
1:53
you go with patch orput or since it's creating something should you post etc etc like questions like these and also
2:00
what uh HTTP status code to use for different different scenarios a lot of
2:06
questions like this even now we still get confused about all these questions and the reason is when people were
2:14
developing these standards uh these widespread HTTP API standards the state
2:20
of the internet and the state of the web and the state of the clients and the
2:25
state of the servers were very different from what we have today and and previously when these standards were
2:33
being developed we were heavily using MPS also known as uh multi-page
2:40
applications and these days if you uh are aware of the front end side of the
2:45
ecosystem then we heavily make use of single page applications know where in
2:51
the first API call the browser makes a request and downloads all the JavaScript that is required required and it
3:00
performs all the routing on the client side using the browser's path and URL
3:05
etc etc it's a completely client side a client heavy application now the purpose
3:11
of this video uh is to standardize not to create new standards but as the
3:18
standards already exist to extract certain rules and guidelines from this
3:23
existing standards we aim to stick to these guidelines to make it as convenient as possible possible for
3:31
everyone to follow A single standard and a consistent styling pattern when
3:37
designing apis know designing apis designing payloads and documentation etc
3:43
etc everything surrounding API design this way we won't have to question these
3:48
issues anymore these common issues that backend Engineers face in day-to-day lives we can simply move forward with
3:56
our development now we already have this standard in place and by sticking to
4:01
them we can focus on our business logic instead of worrying about whether our API is restful or not or whether we are
4:07
following the latest industry standards or not etc etc so in this video we will explore API design from end to end
4:14
starting from how to design your resources how to design your routes how to return success responses how to
4:20
return error responses which status code to use what kind of data to accept and much much more essentially everything
4:27
related to API design so that we can concentrate on our business logic after
4:32
this video we can move on from standards and we'll get into execution phase now
4:37
before we start about the technical stuff the actual API designing part
4:43
let's talk a little bit about the history of where we are coming from and
4:49
why we are talking about it so that we have a little more context so in 1990
4:55
Tim berners Le started a project called the worldwide web to share knowledge
5:01
with the whole world that was the initial motivation for starting what we
5:06
call as Internet today and this project was built to facilitate the sharing of
5:13
knowledge and information globally and with that goal team mesly within a year
5:20
or so invented all these different concepts or Technologies first one URI
5:27
what we call as uniform resource identifier second one HTTP the HTTP
5:33
protocol that uh we use underneath to communicate between client
5:39
and servers we have already covered how HTTP works and etc etc in previous video so you can check that out third HTML
5:47
HTML is basically the markup language which we use to construct web pages what
5:54
you can call is the skeleton of a page fourth the first web server fifth the
6:02
first web browser and sixth the first what you see is what you get editor an
6:11
HTML editor which was built directly into the browser now he built all these
6:18
things which we still use today by the way and we use the advanced and the more
6:25
developed version of all these Technologies we still use Uris we still use make use of HTTP protocols now uh it
6:33
started with HTTP 1.1 then now we have HTTP 2.0 and 3.0 etc etc we still make
6:40
use of HTML right we still use HTML we have a lot of different types of web servers
6:47
these days we have a lot of different types of browsers these days etc etc and we also have the browsers uh in built
6:53
HTML editor right so he invented and he came up with all these new technologies
6:59
and Concepts within an year or so but soon now the problem arises the problem
7:07
was the project which was known as the
7:12
worldwide web was headed towards breakdown because of the exponential growth of its user base within a short
7:19
period of time a lot of users a lot of people started using this new technology
7:24
which is known as the worldwide web and the Creator uh Team Bal Le he had not
7:30
accounted for all this uh scale all this number of users when he was building the
7:36
project this was not accounted for so to scale the web to accommodate this large
7:43
user base new techniques standards and components had to be introduced the
7:49
previous one the all the mindsets and all the Technologies and all the
7:54
planning that went behind creating or coming up with all these Technologies was not enough to scale the web to
8:02
account for the huge user base that it was acquiring every day it was scaling
8:08
exponentially now at this point we have one other major contributor to the
8:13
project web so around 1993 Roy Fielding the co-founder of the
8:20
Apache HTTP server project became concerned about the web scalability problem that we just talked about the
8:27
web was not ready to accommodate this large user base the thousands and
8:32
thousands of users and people that were using the worldwide web project every day to address this issue uh and make
8:40
the worldwide web more scalable he proposed a couple of constraints that could help achieve the
8:47
goal and these constraints are number one client server which we still follow
8:53
by the way the client server model this constraint basically emphasizes the separation of con concerns between the
9:00
client and the server the client handles all the user interface the user
9:06
experience while the server manages data storage and business logic which we also
9:11
call as the front end and back end this separation allows each component to
9:17
evolve independently and to improve scalability that's the first constraint
9:23
the second constraint is uniform interface this constraint simplifies the
9:29
overall system architecture by establishing a standardized way a
9:34
standardized way of components different different components that the web
9:39
comprises of to communicate with each other it also includes uh four subc
9:46
constraints which are called resource identification resource manipulation
9:51
through representation self-descriptive messages and Hyper media as the engine of
9:57
application State we have also sub constraints under this one the uniform interface the philosophy of uniform
10:03
interface the uniformity provides a consistent interface across all the services third one layered system now
10:11
this says that the architecture composed of hierarchical layers and each layer
10:17
can only see and interact with the immediate layer below it and this allows
10:22
for better scalability security and the ability to add intermediate components like load balancers and prox servers Etc
10:31
which we use today to scale our web applications to cater to millions of
10:37
users right and and this happens without affecting the system's core functionality now fourth cach cach uh
10:46
responses from the server must be explicitly labeled as the cachable or non-cashable that's what this constraint
10:52
says the server should label different different responses as whether it should be cached or not by the client and when
11:01
the clients need they can cash the responses which helps reduce the server
11:07
load uh improve Network efficiency and enhance the user experience by providing faster response times now fifth one is
11:17
stateless now stateless we have already covered in a much more depth in the
11:22
previous video I think it was the HTTP video uh this basically means that each request from the client to the server
11:30
must contain all the information necessary to understand the and process the request the server basically will
11:38
not remember what your previous request was about with each request you have to include all the information necessary uh
11:45
so that the server can identify you and the server can take your data understand it and process it that's what stateless
11:53
means and the server does not store any client context between requests and this
11:59
in turn improves reliability scalability and visibility since any server can
12:04
handle the request let's say you are scaling your web application and you
12:09
have added two more servers and there is a load balancer in between which forwards your traffic depending on
12:16
different different algorithm like round robin etc etc and because of this stateless constraint all the servers can
12:25
process request from the same client because of the statelessness nature of
12:31
the web because all the requests consist all the information that the server needs to process the data and the sixth
12:39
one which is code on demand this is an optional one uh which means that servers
12:45
can temporarily extend client functionality by transferring executable code like JavaScript to the client and
12:53
this is only an optional constraint in rest architecture because it provides flexibility to add client side
13:00
functionality when we need it uh while maintaining other constraints and etc etc this is not something you will see
13:07
getting used heavily these six are basically all the constraints that Roy
13:13
Fielding came up with to solve the problem of scalability in web and later
13:19
on Fielding worked with Team Berner Le and both of them together worked to
13:26
increase the scalability of web and and to standardize their designs and
13:32
together they wrote a specification for the new version of HTTP which we today
13:39
know as HTTP 1.1 the first major version the first standard version of the HTTP
13:46
protocol and then in the year 2000 after the scalability crisis of web was avered
13:54
Fielding Roy Fielding named and described the web's architecture style
14:00
in his PhD dissertation and it was called as rest representational State
14:07
transfer which was Roy fielding's PhD dissertation that was the name that Fielding gave to his description of the
14:14
web architectural style and which today we know as rest apis and if you go and
14:22
search Roy Fielding rest paper you can directly open this and and read the
14:30
first document that was written about Rest apis by ra fielding and you can get
14:38
more insight more context and what uh LED them to come up with all these
14:43
patterns come up with all these Concepts etc etc right it is a must read if you are a backend engineer reading this
14:48
gives you a lot of context about where all these Technologies originated from
14:54
all these Technologies patterns standards that we have today okay great
15:00
now that brings us to why is it called a rest API what does it actually mean if
15:08
you read the paper that was uh written by Roy Fielding you'll definitely get the idea why was he calling it rest
15:15
architecture or restful architecture or rest API but if you want to make it
15:21
brief why the name rest why the name representational State transfer then we
15:28
can up with some points number one is
15:34
representational the first part of this name r which means representation this
15:40
basically means that resources on the internet resources on the web which
15:45
means data or objects are represented in a specific format they have a specific
15:52
representation depending on the specific servers and specific clients and these
15:58
representations can be in various formats it can be in Json that is the most popular uh
16:04
representation format that we have these days but we also have
16:09
XML and we also have HTML so different different representations depending on
16:16
different different context for example a server to server communication will depend on the Json based representation
16:23
while a server to client based communication depend on the HTML ml
16:29
based communication right that's what representation means when we are talking
16:34
about web's architecture the rest API architecture the same resource can have
16:39
different representation based on the client's needs so a user for example
16:45
let's say we have a user resource which might have different different fields an ID field a name field a created at field
16:55
etc etc so let's say we have a user resource a database resource let's
17:03
assume so a user resource this can have different different representation
17:08
depending on different different clients let's say this can be represented as a Json right for an API client let's say
17:15
another server is making a request to get this object or get this resource then this can have a Json based
17:22
representation but if we want to send some uh UI data to the browser then we
17:29
can represent this as an HTML document or as some kind of HTML representation
17:35
right for the client which is a web browser so that's what we mean by representational in the restful
17:41
architecture coming back to the second part state representational state transfer so what do we mean by state
17:48
here State basically refers to the current condition or attributes of a
17:54
particular resource the current property of a resource the state of the resource
17:59
and each resource let's say we had a user resource here so each resource has
18:05
a state that can be transferred between client and server and the state is
18:11
driven by the resource representation so taking an example let's say we have a uh
18:18
e-commerce site let's say we have Amazon we have Amazon and we have a shopping
18:24
cart in the cart we have a couple of items so a shopping cart State includes
18:30
all the items the quantities of the items and the total price so that we can
18:37
call as a state of a particular resource of a particular module that we have in
18:42
our web application that is transferred between a client and a server with each
18:47
API call and the last part which is transfer representational State transfer
18:55
the third part talks about transfer what does transfer mean so transfer basically indicates the movement of resource the
19:03
movement of resource representations between client and server so obviously since we have a client server model the
19:10
primary intention of that is sending data between client and server and the client and server can exchange different
19:17
representations of the same resource we have a client here and we have a server
19:22
here and the transfer of data happens uh through a common standard which is
19:29
HTTP and we have uh different different methods associated with that which is
19:36
get post uh put delete patch options head etc etc right we have all these
19:43
different different uh methods which we use to send data between client and
19:49
server for example when you get a web page when you uh send a get request to a
19:54
server for a web page you are transferring a repres presentation from server to client using an common HTTP
20:03
method which is get so when we combine this when we combine all these three
20:09
elements uh which is called representational State transfer or also
20:15
known as rest or restful or rest API this describes an architectural style
20:21
where one resources are representated in different formats we have different
20:27
different formats we have J on we have HTML we have XML etc etc first thing is resources have different different
20:33
formats second the state of these resources can be transferred between
20:38
server and client client and server first is the format of the resource the second is the state of the resource
20:45
third clients and servers communicate between each other by sharing these
20:51
representations of a resource okay the representations can be different but the
20:57
idea is client and server communicate with each other using these representations and third the system
21:04
this whole system follows specific constraints specific constraints to make the whole workflow more scalable right
21:12
which we have already discussed so that's what we mean by restful API or
21:19
rest architecture that's the history behind uh where and when and how we came
21:26
up with this whole architecture this whole model of representing resources
21:32
and transferring resources between client and servers and different different formats etc etc right this is
21:38
all the theory that you need to understand on a very high level you don't need to remember any of it but
21:45
this gives you a little bit of context of where and how we came up with all these things and where are we currently
21:53
let's start with a URL and this is what a typical high level structure of a URL
22:00
looks like know in any website that we visit this part what we call is the
22:05
scheme uh whether it can be HTTP or it can be https the secure version the
22:11
encrypted version then we have the authority or the domain it can also have
22:17
a subdomain but in this case we have the main domain which is sly. XYZ then we have the resource or the
22:25
path so this part uh uh is called the resource that we are trying to access
22:32
and this symbol the forward slash symbol represents a hierarchical relationship
22:39
between different resources and then we have the query parameters which we use
22:45
in usually get apis to pass some kind of key value pairs to give more information
22:52
to server about uh some kind of filters parameters etc etc then we have
23:01
fragments uh this section usually uh navigates you to a particular section of
23:07
a web page if this is present in the URL when you first time navigate to a web
23:13
page if you have a fragment then the browser Scrolls you to that part of the
23:20
page okay so this is what a typical uh website URL looks like now we since we
23:27
are talking about apis and best apis starting from this what would a an API
23:32
URL or an API route will look like so we can start from this we will obviously
23:39
have the scheme so let's imagine we have the encrypted version the secure version htps then we will have a subdomain so
23:47
I'm talking about the industri standard right this is not a rule uh this is more of a standard or best practices that
23:55
most companies follow uh when they are implementing when they're creating their backends so usually it starts with a
24:02
subdomain of the main with a subdomain of API so API dot let's say example
24:12
example.com okay this is the subdomain part subdomain part then we have
24:20
versioning most apis implement or follow some kind of versioning pattern and usually through routes so this will
24:28
follow something like V1 or V2 etc etc then we reach the path or the resource
24:35
that we are trying to access so let's imagine it is a it is an API which is
24:42
like good reads if you are aware of good read it's a platform where there are a
24:48
lot of books there are a lot of authors and books are associated with authors you can provide your reviews feedbacks
24:56
etc etc it's a whole community about readers and authors and books Etc if
25:02
this API is of good RS then an apaa
25:07
which fetches all the list of books will have something of a structure like this
25:13
so then we write the name of the resource so book now the first rule is
25:20
in an API when you're designing a route when you're designing an API in the path
25:25
segment whatever resource that you you are providing whatever resource your
25:31
client is trying to access or whatever resource the backend is serving that
25:36
should always be in the plural form it is a standard that all the resources in
25:42
your path segment of the URL should be of plural form so ideally it should be books okay then we have this API uh
25:50
which has the subdomain api. example.com SL we have the versioning here and then
25:55
we have books this is an API to list all the books to fetch the list of all books
26:02
similarly we can have another API so let's say we remove this this this let's
26:10
say we have another AP which fetches a single book so up to this point we have
26:19
bit constant right uh of course the we can have different different versions of
26:25
the same API but for the sake of this example let's imagine up to this point
26:31
we are in the version one only and this part is constant we will have the scheme https then we will have the subdomain
26:38
api. example.com then we'll have the version in which is the V1 but in the
26:43
second API we want to fetch the information for a single book so what
26:48
will the path look like now there is one mistake here which most people do is since we are fetching the information of
26:55
single book uh people make this as a singular now right they make this slash
27:01
book or then whatever the book ID etc etc you should not do that because um
27:07
even though you are fetching the information of a single book but the resource that it is concerned about this
27:14
resource which is the book resource that is represented as a plural noun when we
27:22
are dealing with path segments in the URL so even if this is about a single
27:27
book we have to put we have to make it plural here so it will still be books
27:33
then we have the ID now uh since we are talking about URLs one thing that you
27:40
have to uh keep in mind when you're are designing apis are the readability the
27:46
representation of URLs in browsers or different different client environments couple of things that you have to
27:54
remember is you should not put spaces or under scores etc etc these characters in
28:00
a URL whether it can be a uh slug or whether it can be an ID know whatever
28:07
part that you're dealing with for a route you should not put spaces or
28:12
underscores in a URL the thumb roll is if you have a phrase which has spaces
28:19
and you want to put that into the URL let's say uh we have this API and we
28:24
want to fetch the information of a single book and we want to fet the information using the slug of the book
28:30
now slug is basically the name or some property of the book let's say the name
28:38
of this book is Harry Potter the name of this book is Harry Potter now the slug
28:45
of this book will be a human readable representation of some property of that
28:53
resource which is ideal to put inside a URL
28:58
which means first thing that we do to convert this into a slug is we make all
29:04
of this a small case even though we can put Capital case but because the URL
29:10
will be traveling to different different environments it will travel to different server environments different client
29:16
environments different operating system we don't want to mess with the case
29:21
mismatch etc etc right so first thing that we'll do is we make both of this as
29:27
smaller is the first change is the part okay this is the first change second
29:34
every time we have a space we will replace that with a hyphen now we have
29:40
the final slug which is Harry Potter and now we can put this into a URL so/ book
29:47
SL Harry Potter one thing that I mentioned a while bag is I said whenever
29:53
we use this character the forward SL character in a URL uh uh in an API route
29:59
in a path segment this means there is a hierarchical relationship between these
30:04
resources so for example this API this says that we have a resource a
30:12
collection of resource which are called books in our server in our database or
30:19
wherever your storage is and that is the first level of hierarchy the second
30:25
level of hierarchy is we want to access one particular resource from that collection of resource that resides in
30:32
our database or some kind of storage so this is what I meant whenever we use the
30:39
path segment you have to uh think of this as a hierarchical relationship
30:44
between different resources okay so I think that's pretty much all the primer about URLs uh that we need to talk about
30:52
right now we'll of course explore more about how to design your routes in different different apis
30:58
when we get to the demo part okay so moving on another important concept that
31:03
we have when we are talking about restas is em potency this is a very important
31:10
theoretical concept uh of course it has a practical implication but the concept
31:16
of item potency basically means the property of certain operations in which
31:22
performing the same action multiple times has the same effect as performing it once
31:28
which means an action which you have performed using an API call it does not
31:33
matter how many times you perform that action the effect the side effect the
31:39
change that happens in that environment Remains the Same it does not matter how
31:44
many times you perform that action that's what we mean by em potency so in this context in the context uh where we
31:51
are talking about rest apis item potency basically means it does not matter how
31:57
many times the client performs a particular request the outcome the
32:03
result of that request in the server environment Remains the Same so even if
32:08
I call an API once or I call the API thousand times the outcome of that the
32:15
result of that should be the same if we call a particular API or a particular
32:21
action is item poent now as you already know when talking about different different actions that we can perform
32:28
using API calls we come to the concept of HTTP methods and in the previous
32:36
video of HTTP we have already discussed this in depth what are the different types of methods how they work what are
32:42
the properties Etc ET so we have around five major kinds of methods that we use
32:49
to handle different different data operations okay we have get we have post
32:56
we have put we have patch and we have delete okay these are the five major
33:02
methods we have other methods also head and options etc etc which um head is used to patch the headers information
33:10
and options is used to uh options is used in our course flow to find out
33:15
whether the origin is allowed or not etc etc right but majorly these are the five
33:21
kinds of methods that we use for data transfer between clients and servers now relating the concept of emut see two s
33:29
methods uh gives us a lot of insights into which method should we use in which
33:34
context okay now the get call which we
33:39
usually use to fetch some information from the server now this method is used
33:45
to retrieve data from a server and it is em potent a get method or a get action
33:53
on a server is considered as item poent because it does not matter how many
33:58
times you perform a get request you will get the same outcome right let's say we
34:03
in the previous example we are fetching a list of books we fetching a list of books so it does not matter how many
34:10
times you call this API you'll get a list of books and now you must be
34:15
thinking what if uh while you're are making these API calls someone else creates another book and the result
34:22
changes the response of the API changes in the subsequent calls of the G and and
34:28
that's true but that is not what we consider when we are talking about item poent item poent basically means from
34:35
the client using an API call what side effect can you cause in the server and whether that side effect is different
34:42
with each API call or that remains same during the first API call or the 1,000
34:48
API call okay now and because of that reason the get call is considered item
34:54
poent it does not matter how many times you fetch some information you do not make any change with your API call in
35:02
the server environment okay it is just a fetch operation that's why the get is called an item Buton method similarly
35:10
the patch method and the put method these two methods that we generally use
35:15
to update some data in the server to update a particular resource or a part
35:22
of a resource we use patch when we up we want to update a part of a resource let's say a single single field or two
35:28
three fields of a resource in the server in that case we use patch we use put when we want to completely replace the
35:35
representation of resource in the server using the client payload so let's say we
35:41
have a user object in the server it has ID it has name it has created at etc etc
35:49
and for an update operation if we want to update the name of the user if you
35:56
want to use the p method then we can just send the name field with the new
36:01
value of the name and the server will handle it accordingly it will just update the name but using put method
36:09
what it does we have to send both the ID the name the created all the fields in
36:15
that payload so that the server can take that payload and completely replace it
36:20
with whatever instance of that user object the server has currently now it is true that um most of the time put and
36:28
Patch is used interchangeably and that is fine that is fine to some extent uh
36:36
as long as you using your API internally but let's imagine you are building some
36:42
kind of public API in that case you have to implement your API specs in a way
36:48
that sticks to the standard as much as it can so that other people other
36:54
Engineers who want to integrate your API do not get confused because they assume
36:59
that you are following a standard but you are not so if you are using put when
37:05
you should be using patch then that gives some kind of wrong assumption and it might be a confusing situation but
37:13
again it does not cause as much of a harm because obviously from the behavior of the a people can tell whether it is a
37:21
patch operation happening or I put operation but yes uh you should always try to stick to the standard stick to
37:27
the semantic standard that the rest a offers so if you want to update a
37:34
particular resource partially then use patch if you want to completely replace the representation of a resource then
37:40
use put okay now patch and put are also called as emed because let's say we are
37:48
updating the name of the user with a new value let's say the previous name of the user was a and we want to replace it
37:56
with the new payload which is B okay so we make our first API call and we send
38:03
this payload okay and the name of the user becomes from A to B that's the side
38:10
effect that we caused using our API in the first API call what happens in the second API call the name of the user is
38:17
already B but we make the same API call with the same payload now from B it
38:22
again changes to B okay now that continues it does not matter how many times you all that API it can be
38:29
thousand it can be million but the result will be same after each operation the state of the user Remains the Same
38:35
the name is still B you are not causing different side effects with each API
38:40
call that's the reason patch andp put any kind of update operation with the
38:46
same payload will obviously be item now we have ruled out get and patch and put
38:53
as uted methods next up is delete now what do you think delete is whether it
38:58
is item button or not now imagine again we have this user object uh which has an
39:04
ID name and created at field and we make a delete API call to the server and we
39:11
deleted this user this user does not exist that is the result of the first
39:17
API call what happens in the second API call you make the same request to delete
39:23
the API uh to delete the user which has the ID as one okay you made the same API
39:31
call in the first payload with the user ID one and you are making the same API call again with the user ID on you want
39:37
to delete this user in the second API call since this user is already deleted
39:43
the server checks your payload it checks whether the user exists or not and it
39:48
sends you an error that this user does not exist it sends you a 404 error since
39:54
you are trying to perform some action on an entity which does not exist that's
39:59
the reason you are getting a 404 error but did you cause any side effect in the second AP go you did not because in the
40:06
first API call you deleted the user in the second API call nothing really happened the server just checked whether
40:11
the user exists or not and it send you an error but nothing really changed no
40:18
state of the entity changed in the server it it had no side effects that's
40:24
the reason it does not matter how many times you call this delete API call you can call it a million times you'll
40:29
get the same error million times that this user does not exist you only made
40:35
the change in the first API call and that's the reason delete is also considered as an item poent method at
40:41
last we reach post now this is the only
40:47
method in the HTTP semantics which is considered as a nonm poent method
40:54
because when we use a post request usually the post request is used when we
41:00
want to create a new resource or a new entity in the server so taking from our
41:06
previous example which was a book API if you want to create a new book we want to
41:12
add a new book to our inventory in that case we'll send the name of the book and
41:19
some kind of description some kind of um weight Dimensions Etc different
41:26
different properties of the book and we will take this payload put it in the
41:31
body and we send this to the server in a post call and the server receives it it
41:37
takes the payload and it performs some kind of database operation and in it
41:43
inserts that uh entity into the database it creates a new book now that's that's
41:50
what happened in the first AP call in the second API call let's imagine you made the same payload with the same name
41:56
description ion bit Dimensions etc etc you just took the Cur of that request
42:02
and you executed that Cur again you made the same API call again what happens now
42:07
there is a chance that um in this API the name has to be
42:14
unique if that is one condition that your server is following or your database is following then you might get
42:22
an error which is the name cannot be duplicate ET
42:27
but for the sake of this example and it for the sake of real world scenario it
42:33
is often the case that names can be duplicated right multiple books can have the same name right the that's that's
42:41
the reason we differentiate between different books from their IDs not from
42:46
the names so that's the reason uh when you make the same API call in the second time what happens the server takes your
42:54
payload it performs the same operation and it inserts it into the database now you have the second book with the same
43:00
information right but with a different ID IDs are usually generated at the database level uh whether uu ID or some
43:07
kind of Serial value 1 2 3 4 ET IDs are generated at the database level that's the reason you can have multiple books
43:13
with the same kind of properties name description weight Dimensions etc etc but the IDS will be different that's the
43:19
reason an error does not occur that's the second API call and this is the pattern with each API call you are
43:26
creating a new book and when you if you call this API a thousand times you'll have a thousand new books now what we
43:35
discussed what is the property of what is the condition of idency the side effects that you cause in the server
43:42
should not be different with each request right but it's the opposite
43:48
happening for the Post calls right with each API call you are creating a new book the side effects are changing and
43:54
that's the reason post request post methods are are called nonm poent Methods now one more thing about post is
44:02
whenever we have a noncured operation an operation an action that does not fall
44:08
under any of the methods that is defined by HTTP spec right it is not a fetch
44:14
operation it is not an update operation not a create operation not a delete operation it does not fall under any of
44:20
the methods in that scenario because of the existence of scenarios like these
44:26
the s spec the rest AP spec has made the post method as open-ended which means
44:33
whenever you find yourself in a scenario where you cannot put some action
44:39
some uh action in any of the existing methods then you can put that under the
44:46
post call in the post method so let's imagine we have an API which uh says we
44:53
which is like send email okay we have this AP and when we call this we can
44:59
send an email to a client so let's say the payload the body of this API call
45:06
looks something like this target is some email address right and when we make
45:12
this API call the server takes it and extracts the
45:17
payload the target email and sends the email that is basically the functionality of this API now the point
45:25
that I'm trying to make here is what HTTP method that you would assign to
45:30
this action or this API because it say send email but is this a fetch operation
45:37
it's not right it is some kind of action we want to tell the server that do
45:42
perform this action whether it is a create operation it's not it's not an update or delete operation either that's
45:49
the reason it is called a custom action in the HTTP or rest AP terminology so
45:55
whenever we have scenarios like is whenever we have custom actions the
46:00
operations or API calls which we cannot categorize under any of the Curr operations those are the situations that
46:08
we can make use of the post method which is meant to be used for custom actions
46:14
as for the rest TP specification okay and that's pretty much all about HTTP
46:19
methods uh when we are talking about rest apis now let's move on to some demo
46:26
right how exactly do you start with your API design how do you actually design the
46:33
interface for your API the interface that other clients whether it is server
46:39
based clients or browser based clients any kind of clients can uh talk to can
46:45
interact the first thing if you are a backend engineer the first thing before
46:51
you start coding before you write any of the business Logic the first thing you
46:56
should do uh while creating an API is designing the interface for the API the interface
47:03
should be intuitive it should be delightful to use and it should not be
47:08
vague it should follow most of the standards of uh rest apis and the reason
47:14
for that is the reason for following standards the reason for
47:21
following restful standards is to eliminate uh confus usion eliminate
47:28
assumptions or any kind of human related errors in your whole workflow what that
47:36
means is let's say you are designing your apis and you did not follow any of
47:43
the standards and uh whenever you should have used put you used uh post and you
47:51
used delete operation to perform fetch operation ET ET you messed up the AP
47:57
interface completely intentionally now as a result someone the consumer whoever
48:02
that is any engineer who is integrating your API the only way the only way for
48:09
them to find out all the behavior of your API starting from the successful
48:15
Behavior and the error behavior and how the payloads are structured how the data
48:20
is structured and what uh method to call ET the complete API integration workflow
48:27
for them to figure it out completely they have only two options they have to
48:32
either read your code if it is open source or it is someone within your
48:37
organization who has access to your code or they have to try out different methods and see as a result of the
48:43
deoration if it is expected or not and you can see that that that's a lot of
48:50
room for error a lot of room for confusions and assumption etc etc now
48:56
having a common standard and following a particular standard in your workflows
49:01
especially when you're designing API interfaces gives you and all the consumers of your apis the advantage
49:09
that they do not have to do any kind of guess work most of the behaviors are
49:14
already defined in the standard so assuming that assuming the standards are
49:20
uh at least 80% followed in most cases the the effort and the time to integrate
49:27
the API decreases a lot when you follow standards and uh there are less bugs
49:34
there are less confusions and there are less synup calls with the uh whoever is
49:39
integrating your apas Etc ET because all the uh you have been following all the standards the documentations are in
49:45
place you have an interactive API uh playground etc etc now there is almost
49:51
no room for errors or confusions right that is the advantage of following standards following best practices so
49:58
that the creator of the API and the consumer of the API already have some
50:04
some kind of knowledge that this API will have these kinds of behaviors and
50:10
there is no guess for involved there the first thing what is the first thing that you should do as a backend engineer when
50:16
you are creating an API you should start with is from your UI design interface it
50:22
could be uh figma or any other kind of software that your designer or your
50:29
product team uses to build wireframes or uh user stories etc etc now that's the
50:35
place you should start with when you're designing an API because when you follow the wireframe you have an idea that how
50:44
the end user not the frontend engineer the engineer F consumer API will
50:50
interact with it you but you will have an idea that how the end user the users who are going to use your platform are
50:58
going to interact with data in general so uh usually this is how it works you
51:04
have your users they interact with your platform the platform is built by your
51:11
front end engineer and your front-end engineer consumes whatever API that you
51:16
have built and you in turn interact with different different databases Etc as
51:21
like you know the DB level so in a way when you look at the W frames the
51:27
designs of how the users are going to interact with your platform you have a
51:34
very good understanding of how the user the first level of consumption are
51:41
related to the last the low level of uh consumption which is the database right
51:49
and forgetting about all this middlemen that comes into play whenever
51:55
uh we have the whole SAS platform Etc once you have the clarity on how your
52:01
users are related to your data and that's an excellent point to start your
52:07
actual API interface design because at this point you will find out what are
52:13
the resources so since we are talking about restas the first important concept
52:18
the first important entity uh that we should cover is resources now the resources are
52:25
basically any any kind of nouns that you can identify from your wireframes or by
52:32
talking to your clients by understanding the requirements after you understood
52:37
all the requirements whether by um from the whether from the wireframes or from
52:43
talking to different people the product people or client people etc etc once you have the requirements from those
52:48
requirements whatever noun you can find okay of of course this is an oversimplified uh definition of what are
52:56
resource in a backend workflow but mostly this rule works this is a kind of
53:03
a thumb rule so whatever nouns you can find from there are your resources so
53:09
imagine it is a uh project you are working on a project which is a project
53:17
management SAS a project management platform okay uh something like uh jira
53:24
or linear etc etc you working on a product which is similar to J linear
53:30
which is a project management platform now after going through all the wireframes all the figma designs and
53:35
after talking to your clients your product people you can analyze your requirements and you can find out some
53:42
of the nouns that come up in those requirements what could be some of the nouns the obvious ones are since this is
53:49
a project management platform it will have projects right this is the first noun what is the second noun your users
53:58
obviously it's a project management platform it will have users users are another noun then you can have
54:05
organizations users can be part of different different organization so that is another uh resource that you can come
54:12
up with then each project will have tasks associated with it there is
54:17
another noun then uh task can be um organized with different different tags
54:24
so tags are another noun similarly as you can see the pattern once you have
54:29
analyzed your figma designs you can easily come up with these resources and you can note it down and once you have
54:36
all the resources noted down you have figured out uh what are the different different resources that your back end
54:43
that your platform will have okay the nouns the top level entities after this
54:49
uh usually you jump into the database schema right since uh this video is only
54:56
about the rest DPA side of it which usually comes after you have done with your DB schema designs the next video of
55:02
course deals with uh all the DV schema designs and different different concepts of databases so we'll skip this part how
55:11
you design your DV schema how you um interact with your databases all the
55:16
concepts surrounding Etc ET we'll leave this for the next video we'll focus only on the rest of part this is what the
55:22
workflow looks like once you have identified all the resources from your fig designs you jump into your DB schema
55:28
design and after you done with your DB schema design you get to your API
55:34
interface design part since we are not talking about uh the DB schema design and all in this video we'll just do a
55:40
very quick uh schema design so that we can continue to the rest API phase of
55:46
the API design workflow since we have skipped the database schema design part
55:52
which we'll cover in the next video Let's imagine you are done with your databas schema design and you have these
55:58
three tables okay uh since it's a project management platform you started with these three tables you have the
56:04
organization table where you will keep track of all the organizations that exist in your platform then you have
56:11
project uh what are all the projects that exist within an organization then
56:17
you have task uh inside task you will keep uh track of what are all the tasks
56:22
that are created inside a project so for the sake of this demo and for the sake
56:28
of this video uh we are building the API interface for a project management platform and we will get started with
56:36
this schema design we have an organization table we have a project table have task table with this we will
56:42
start our API design now the next thing to do we have already uh gone through
56:48
our figma designs and understood all the requirements we have come up with all the nouns all the resources that we have
56:54
to create and using the resources we have created all the database schemas and now we have database tables now we
57:02
have we already know the resources of our platform now we need to create apis
57:07
for that the next thing to do since we already have this schema the next thing to do is finding out what are the
57:15
actions that a client a typical client who will interact with your API needs to
57:22
perform on our server what are the actions and you can get started uh with
57:28
some template actions using our crud API endpoints right uh a typical resource
57:33
will have fetchall uh get a single resource update delete create etc etc
57:39
right using that you will you will list out all the actions that you need to uh
57:45
the users need to perform using your API which we usually call is CR operations
57:51
create read update and delete and after you know all the actions you'll jum jump
57:56
into the API interface design part and for the API interface design part we'll
58:02
use this Tool uh which is called insomnia uh it's an alternative to
58:08
postman it is an alternative to postman but it has lesser features and it's a
58:15
lighter in weight as compared to postman so we'll make use of this tool to uh design the interface of our API what
58:23
should the API of this platforms look like right remember we are designing the interface for this API which means that
58:31
uh we are designing how clients who are going to consume our API who are going
58:37
to integrate our API what the apis will look like how they will interact with
58:42
etc etc right the interface point we are designing the interface Point not the
58:47
execution point which includes writing whatever programming language that
58:52
you're writing your server in etc etc your actual business logic your database interactions Etc ET we are
58:58
not going to cover that in this part we are only going to be concerned about the
59:04
design of your API okay with that uh let's start so we have identified three
59:11
uh major resources in our API which are uh organization project and task right
59:18
so we have to design API surrounding these three resources starting with organization and we have also identified
59:25
what are the actions that clients need to perform with our a so according to
59:30
those we have come up with five different kinds of actions for organization uh create organization get
59:37
all organizations get a single organization and update organization
59:42
delete organization etc etc right so let's start how the AP will look like I will create a new HTTP request so the
59:51
first let's design the get all organizations AP so it is it will be a
59:56
get API because we are doing a fetch operation right now the next thing is we'll write the URL of our server now
1:00:05
this is subject to change uh when you go to production uh the domain will change the scheme will change from HTTP to
1:00:12
https and since I am running it in Local Host the scheme is HTTP and the domain
1:00:17
is Local Host and my server is running on Port 3000 that's that and since it is just a
1:00:24
demo we have not uh integrated versioning here but usually uh apis will
1:00:29
have some kind of versions here/ V1 then the actual path will come but here we are not doing versioning as of now so we
1:00:37
are done with the URL part now comes the important part the actual route the actual path segment which is going to um
1:00:44
identify what is that that we are trying to fetch from the server since it is an
1:00:50
API so let's rename this to list organizations right
1:00:56
list all organization so this is what it looks like right as I already said uh we
1:01:02
don't put Capital case in the path segment so we write organization and we
1:01:08
have already mentioned that uh it should always be plural the resource part so it
1:01:14
will be organizations this is what a typical list uh resource API looks like
1:01:21
you have the domain you have the versioning if it exists and then uh the resource name in plural so this is
1:01:29
ideally the list API and when we call this we are getting the empty response
1:01:38
okay the empty response so let's jump into the second API uh which is the create organization AP then we'll have a
1:01:45
better idea about how the get one works right create organization and this will
1:01:50
be a post operation because we are creating a resource in the server right it's a create operation that's why we
1:01:57
are using the method post uh let's just copy this and paste this now here our
1:02:07
URL looks pretty much the same for list organizations and for create
1:02:13
organization and the reason for that is the server differentiates between these
1:02:19
two API calls using the HTTP method if it is a post method then this route goes
1:02:25
towards the controller which handles creating an organization and if it is a get call with the same URL it goes to
1:02:32
the controller which deals with listing all the organizations right so this is what a typical create operation for a
1:02:39
particular resource looks like uh we have the as usual the servers address
1:02:44
and Slash the name of the resource in plural form okay now this is a post call
1:02:52
so we have to attach the payload the data that the server needs to create an
1:02:57
organization so if we look at the organization schema we have to exclude
1:03:04
these three Fields these are database handled Fields right the ID the created
1:03:10
it and updated it these are handled from the server side so we exclude these from
1:03:15
the payload now these three Fields the name the status and the description
1:03:22
these three Fields can be passed from the client side using a pay Lo so let's pass these three name status and
1:03:29
description name will provide as Arc one status since it's a Json payload we have
1:03:36
to wrap all the fields in double codes so second is status status let's say is
1:03:43
active and the last one is description is some some description right and these
1:03:49
are payload and when we run this we get this right we have have an ID which is
1:03:57
created in the server s side and we have the created at which is also created in
1:04:03
the server site and then we have the name status and description which we had passed in the payload that is provided
1:04:09
here so this is the first thing that we should notice here in a typical post API
1:04:14
call uh after calling the response is usually 2011 which we return when we
1:04:22
create a resource in the server if a new resource is created cre then we return the status code AS 2011 which means U
1:04:30
created okay and then we return the newly created entity as it is in the
1:04:37
success response that's why we have received the newly created organization here okay this is what the typical post
1:04:43
interaction looks like now going back to our earlier list organization when we
1:04:50
call this now now we are getting the entry the organization that we created
1:04:56
the organization that we created just now using the post call okay here the status code is 200 because 200 uh we
1:05:04
return 200 status code when it is a successful response 2011 is when we create something but 20 is when it is
1:05:12
just a success response we are sending some kind of data etc etc right
1:05:18
this another thing to focus here is What's Happening Here uh we have a data field we have a total field we have a
1:05:25
page field we have total Pages etc etc and this thing is called pagination the
1:05:32
terminology is pagination and why do we actually need pagination the need for
1:05:39
pagination pagination is basically a technique uh which is used in server side when uh we are doing some kind of
1:05:46
API call where a list of a particular resources returned in this case we are
1:05:52
requesting a list of organizations whenever we have an API call like this which returns a list of some kind of
1:05:58
resource and depending on the requirement we use this technique we implement this technique which is called
1:06:04
pagination what it does it does not return all the resources that exist in the database in the server side in that
1:06:11
particular request right it returns a particular portion of the data in the
1:06:19
response okay and since at this point we only have one organization so I cannot
1:06:24
uh show you the difference but we'll create a couple of organization we'll see how the pagination works right so let's understand the theory first so
1:06:31
this is the this is why we use pagination if we have a lot of data in the database and when the client makes
1:06:39
an API call so we only return a particular portion of that data in the
1:06:44
response so that first thing Json serialization and deserialization as we
1:06:50
have already covered in the previous uh some video that is a heavy operation right so if we let's say send a,
1:06:58
organization in the response so serializing a th000 organizations into a
1:07:04
payload which is transferable across uh internet is a resource heavy task right
1:07:12
it can introduce some kind of delay in our API it can have some kind of
1:07:17
performance impact so that is one reason the second is if the server takes a
1:07:23
little longer to send the response then the client uh the whatever the front end platform that is requesting that is
1:07:30
using this API that will also have some kind of perceived delay and the user the
1:07:36
end user who is using the platform they will notice the difference right they will notice there is some kind of 3
1:07:42
seconds and 4 seconds of delay that is happening because the client is fetching a thousand organizations in the list API
1:07:49
call even though even though the on the first look on the first look when
1:07:55
someone is using the platform they will only see let's say a 10 or 20 organization right if they want to see
1:08:03
more organization they'll obviously have to scroll right now because of that kind of scenario people have come up with
1:08:10
this technique called page nation in page Nation what happens in the initial call you return some portion of data
1:08:17
usually from the first and sorted by some parameter let's say the created parameter you return the latest 10
1:08:25
organization in the first API call right then when the user the end user clicks
1:08:31
on page two or if it's an infinite scroll Scrolls down you make another API
1:08:37
call and you say this part I already have give me the next portion this
1:08:43
portion of the data right and then you take this and you show it to the user similarly when the user goes on page
1:08:50
three you ask for this portion and you s this data and this is how it works at at
1:08:55
once you only fetch let's say 20 or 30 organizations and show it to the user so
1:09:00
the user is also not overwhelmed network is not overwhelmed and the client in server perform better and that is the
1:09:07
advantage of pation and this is often used whenever we are implementing some
1:09:12
kind of list API so in this case we are listing organizations right that's why
1:09:19
we have implemented pagination here now the second thing to notice here is what
1:09:24
are the fields that we are returning from in a pag response the first part is data whatever portion of the data we
1:09:31
have to return that we return in the data field the second is total now this
1:09:37
total field Returns the total count of all the organizations that is in the
1:09:43
database and using this information the client can s some kind of metadata to
1:09:49
the user that um you have around 50 organization but at this page you are
1:09:55
only viewing 10 right it can show some kind of UI like this 10 or 50 something something so for representation purpose
1:10:02
for UI purpose we return a field which which uh shows the total count of all
1:10:09
the resources that exist in our database which is independent of what portion of
1:10:15
the data we are returning it is independent of the page response next is we return the Page Field uh which page
1:10:22
which portion of data that the server is is returning for this response this
1:10:28
response which page it is associated with which portion it is right we have
1:10:33
to assign some kind of number some kind of identifier the portion of the data
1:10:39
that we are asking from the server that's the reason we call it a page and in this the server is saying this
1:10:46
response is for page one you are doing page one then we return total Pages how
1:10:52
many pages in total there are and we can use this to show some kind of nice UI
1:10:58
interactions or uh if it's an infinite scroll we can check for each time we are
1:11:03
making the API call we can check whether uh the page and the total Pages if they
1:11:09
are both same then we stop making the API call so because now that we know that uh we have reached the end of the
1:11:15
pages right so this also provides some nice functionalities it helps the front
1:11:22
end make some decisions about whether to make the next API call or not etc etc
1:11:28
this is what a typical paginated response looks like now let's go to the
1:11:34
create a and create a few more organizations right let say organization
1:11:39
2 oration three organization 4 oration five okay we've created Five
1:11:47
organizations and when we go to the list API and we call this we're getting all
1:11:53
five now that we have around five organizations how do we
1:11:58
access let's see how the pageon actually works and how the client can ask for
1:12:04
different different portions of the data using different different parameters since it is a get call the only way we
1:12:11
can send data from client to server some kind of payload data is using query parameters now the server takes two kind
1:12:18
of parameters for controlling how the pagination works the first one is limit
1:12:23
limit basically means what is the count of data that you want in each response
1:12:29
since we have five entries five organizations what if we do limit is two
1:12:36
each time we only want two organizations right the second parameter is page which
1:12:42
portion of the data that you want by default if we don't send page and limit
1:12:48
the server should and remember since we are in designing the interface try to
1:12:54
focus what are the points uh the server should Implement right if the client does not send anything in limited page
1:13:01
the server should set some kind of default values for these so by default
1:13:06
the server sets the value of page as one if the client does not send any kind of
1:13:13
uh parameter in the page parameter same way the limit will be set to something like 10 or 20 if the client does not
1:13:19
send it but here we are explicitly sending it so let's make this request
1:13:25
what happens when we do limit two and when we make this request the server returned us two organizations sorted by
1:13:32
created at know the latest organizations that's why we are getting organization five and organization four because
1:13:39
that's the order that we created we first created organization 4 then organization 5 that's why we are getting
1:13:45
in this order okay second in total the server is returning how many entries are
1:13:51
present in the database yes we have five organizations but we are returning two
1:13:56
okay because the client has passed the limit as two then which portion of the data that the server is returning which
1:14:02
is which page the server is returning which is page one and how many pages are
1:14:08
there in total there are three pages because if the limit is two and the
1:14:14
total number of organizations are five then then to send all the data to
1:14:21
clients the server has to make three pages in The First page there will be two entries in the second page there
1:14:27
will be two entries in the last page there will be one entry okay that's how pation works so when we do page as two
1:14:34
and we keep the limit as two and then we make this request this is what we get we
1:14:40
get organization 3 and organization two in the response basically we have this
1:14:47
whole data portion where we have let's say uh organization 5 4 3 2 and one when
1:14:55
we make page as one we get organization five and organization 4 basically this
1:15:02
portion when we make Pages two we get this portion right three and two and at
1:15:09
the last when we'll make page three we should ideally get only the organization
1:15:14
one because in the in the last page there is only one entry let's change this to page three
1:15:22
and we got organization one and single response because we are asking give us
1:15:28
the page three the last portion of the data so the total is five the current
1:15:33
page is three and the total pages is three okay these are basically the metadata about what is the current state
1:15:41
of pation and this is how the client can and the client should interact with your apis right you should allow for a limit
1:15:49
parameter and a page parameter so that the client can uh conditionally and programmatically access different
1:15:54
different portions of the data so that's pretty much all about pagination how the server should Implement pagination okay
1:16:03
a typical list API also has other parameters let's say let's get rid of
1:16:08
this okay let's get rid of these we don't want to uh look at page Nation anymore and when we send this we get all
1:16:15
the five organization because by default the server sets the limit s 10 or some
1:16:20
random value because even if the client does not send anything in the limit parameter the server should set some
1:16:27
number as limit and page one as default parameters right now let's talk about
1:16:34
sort in a typical list API we a server should also support sorting and this is
1:16:41
how it looks like we can pass one parameter for defining by which field we
1:16:48
want to sort by okay it is typically written as sord by and here we can
1:16:54
provide the name of the field that we want to sort by so here let's say we
1:16:59
want to sort by name we are saying we want to sort by name okay and when we send this you're getting oration 5 4 3 2
1:17:06
1 okay no difference as of now now let's
1:17:11
add another parameter which is called sort order and here let's send ascending and when
1:17:20
we do that here as you can see by default the server was returning all the
1:17:27
organizations in the descending order so by now you should have realized this
1:17:32
rule the rule that the server should ideally ideally take as many as it can s
1:17:41
defaults and by S defaults I mean it should not depend on the client to send
1:17:47
obvious fields for example in a list API by default even if the client does not
1:17:53
send anything we still got a response right we did not get any validation error that you are missing this parameter you're missing the page
1:17:59
parameter um that made our whole experience way better because we did not
1:18:04
have to pass obvious Fields obvious fields are such as page if the client
1:18:10
does not pass the any explicit page the server should set the default pages one
1:18:17
similarly for limit if limit is not passed you should set a default limit
1:18:22
either 10 or 20 something okay same way even if the client does not do any kind
1:18:29
of manual or explicit sorting the server should do some kind of sorting by
1:18:35
default so that the response of the data does not change between different
1:18:40
different API calls if you don't sort by some parameter in the server before sending the response each time the
1:18:47
client makes an API call it will get the response in a random order because the database does not store and entries in
1:18:55
any kind of sequence you have to explicitly do sorts that's the reason by
1:19:00
default if you're creating an API especially a list API you should have some kind of default sort parameters so
1:19:08
by default what uh we usually do we take the created at field take the created at
1:19:15
field and we sort by this field and sort by what order we sort by descending
1:19:20
order now this is the natural state the default state of sort even if the client does not pass anything because it's a
1:19:28
obvious response right we want to list all the entities all the resources in
1:19:35
the descending order of their creation basically all the latest entries right
1:19:40
that is a natural thing to assume from the server side that's the reason this is considered a s default when it comes
1:19:48
to sorting scenarios in list apis but if the client does want to do some kind
1:19:54
kind of explicit setting the server should also support two parameters for sorts one is sort by by which field of
1:20:04
the resource that you want to sort by it can be name it can be status it can be
1:20:09
ID Etc it depends on your implementation but it should have some uh fields from
1:20:15
the resource entry same way uh we should take another parameter which is called
1:20:20
sort order what order the client wants the sort to happen in by default again
1:20:27
even if the client passes a sort by field you will still have to set the default that sort order if not passed
1:20:34
you should set it as descending that is the reason when we did not pass any sort order we still got our data our response
1:20:42
sorted by name in descending order because descending is the default state
1:20:47
of sort order that the server sets even if the client does not send any sort orders but if the client sends ascending
1:20:56
as sort order then the server takes that into account it takes the field it sorts
1:21:01
names in ascending order that's why we got organization 1 2 3 4 5 in the ascending order this is how sorting is
1:21:09
implemented in a typical list API we have covered page naations we have covered sorting there is one last thing
1:21:16
that is usually supported in a list API which is called filtering so let's
1:21:22
remove this and and what filtering means is um even if it's a list API the client
1:21:30
wants to filter that list by some parameters right so let's say let's go
1:21:36
and create an organization in the body we see organization as six and in the
1:21:42
status instead of active we do archived and we create this and this is created
1:21:48
and we got a 2011 response now we go to list and when we send this we are getting this or oration six the latest
1:21:56
one right and the status is archived now what if the client has some kind of
1:22:02
button some kind of switch using which the user can filter the list by saying I
1:22:09
only want all the organizations whose statuses are active or whose statuses
1:22:15
are archived basically some kind of filter functionality and this is how we
1:22:20
add support for filteration in a typical list API so so we take the name of the
1:22:26
field uh so let's say the client wants to filter by status so we add a
1:22:31
parameter which called status and inside this the client can pass what is the
1:22:37
status that it wants to filter by so if we pass archived and when we send this
1:22:45
we only get the list of all the organizations whose status is archived
1:22:51
same way if you pass active and when we send this we only got all the
1:22:56
organizations which has the status as active and this is called filter okay
1:23:03
and is just one field we can also filter by other fields so let's say uh we add
1:23:10
another parameter and the filter is name one the list of all the organizations
1:23:15
whose name is let's say or and when we send this we are getting only one response because um in this scenario in
1:23:23
this example we only have one organization which has the name r for and that's the reason the API is
1:23:29
returning this okay so with that we have covered pagination filtering and sorting
1:23:37
all the features that a typical list API should have okay now moving on let's
1:23:44
create an update API create a new request and it is a patch request right
1:23:51
the thing is I have personally not used used a put implementation of an update
1:23:57
APA as much because usually what we do we take some fields of a resource of an
1:24:04
entity and we want to update those we never want to replace the whole entity
1:24:09
with a payload that is passed from the client okay uh it it was usually a practice when we were building MPS or
1:24:17
multi-page applications but in the single page applications where the data is mostly Json heavy we usually pass
1:24:25
partial fields of a resource and we only want to update those fields so mostly
1:24:31
you will see patch getting used for update appear instead of put and that is
1:24:36
usually best practice because um if it's partial Fields then patch conveys that
1:24:42
semantic meaning in a better way as compared to put which is a little confusing uh but mostly developers use
1:24:49
put and Patch interchangeably so try to stick to the standards uh you patch
1:24:54
whenever you are updating partial Fields oft a resource okay it's a patch request and we have to uh provide the servers
1:25:01
URL so the servers URL is this one paste it here organizations now which
1:25:08
organization that we want to update so this is where a dynamic parameter comes
1:25:13
into play we have already explored what are Dynamic parameters etc etc and our routing video so for now we'll just go
1:25:21
ahead and use it so Dynamic parameter is usually uh some kind of string that we can arbitrarily pass so let's fetch the
1:25:30
list and let's say we want to update this we want to update the status of
1:25:36
organization 6 so let's copy the ID and we take the ID and let's rename this to
1:25:41
date organization okay and as usual this is the server's address we have the path
1:25:49
which is the plural form of the resource organizations and after this we write to
1:25:54
the slash we paste the idid of the organization and this is a valid route
1:25:59
for a patch API con okay we want to update a single organization that's why
1:26:06
we are passing the ID of the organization in the dynamic parameter now the pass request takes a body and
1:26:12
we'll send a Json inside the Json want to update the status of the organization
1:26:19
and the status is the existing status is archived we want to make get active Okay
1:26:25
and let's call this and we call this we are getting the organization six and the
1:26:32
status is active we are successfully updated it the updated the value of the
1:26:38
status field and when we go to the list API call and we call this we are getting the status is active for organization 6
1:26:46
now uh the typical response for an update or a patch API call the success
1:26:52
response is uh the client sends the payload in the body and the server sends a 200 response since it did not create
1:26:59
any resource it is a successful API call that's why it is sending 200 the
1:27:05
response the success response and in the response we are sending the updated data
1:27:11
of the organization okay this is what the typical practice looks like for a patch IPI call now similarly what if we
1:27:19
want to fetch the information of a single organization we want to patch the
1:27:24
information so that's why it'll be a get call so let's first copy copy this and
1:27:29
create a new request let's rename this to get okay get AR and this is a get
1:27:37
call and let's paste this one and getting the information of a single
1:27:43
organization and updating the information of a single organization and deleting a single organizations mostly
1:27:49
what you will see all these three apis the get update and delete for aing single organization the route will look
1:27:56
similar we'll have the server address we'll have the path parameter with the plural form of the resource and with a
1:28:03
slash with a forward slash we'll have the ID in the dynamic parameters place okay this is what the route will look
1:28:10
like and since it's a get call we uh don't pass any body or anything and we
1:28:16
can just execute it and we got the information of the organization we have passed the ID of the organization 6 and
1:28:22
we got the organization six with status code 200 because it is just a successful response we did not create anything we
1:28:29
just fetched information okay at last we have a delete call we want to delete an
1:28:36
organization so let's uh create an HTTP request and rename this to Arc and the
1:28:43
method is delete let's paste this as I said the get call update call and delete
1:28:49
call of a single organization apis will look similar the route will look similar
1:28:55
the only thing that will differentiate them is the method whether it is a get method whether it is a patch method or
1:29:02
it is a delete method okay and we are not sending anybody we are just sending
1:29:07
the ID of the organization in the dynamic parameter and we execute this and when we execute this we do not get
1:29:13
anything uh the response is empty but we got a different status code which is
1:29:19
which is 204 which means no content the server is saying that whatever uh operation that
1:29:28
you're trying to do it was successful that's why the status code starts with 200 series right 200 series all the
1:29:35
codes in the 200 series are success responses whatever you're trying to do you trying to delete a resource that was
1:29:42
successful but there is no content I can send you because it is a delete
1:29:47
operation and it is successful you successfully deleted the organization there is no information about the
1:29:54
organization that I can send you that's what the server is saying that's why we did not get any response in the response
1:30:01
of the delete API call and this is the usual practice whenever we have a delete API call uh we send an empty response
1:30:07
with status code 204 and now when we go back and we get the list organization we
1:30:15
are getting the organization from organization 5 because we deleted the organization six and what happens uh
1:30:21
when we come to the get call the get single organization API call and we run
1:30:26
this we are getting organization not found as an error message and in the
1:30:32
status code in the status code we are getting 404 so this is an ideal use case
1:30:39
for status 404 which basically says that you are requesting a particular entity
1:30:47
you are requesting a particular entity a particular resource which has the ID this one and that resource does not
1:30:54
exist in the server since we have already deleted this that does not exist in the server that's why we are wrting
1:31:00
returning error code of 404 which means resource not pound okay but in the list
1:31:08
API call we do not get any error even if there are no organizations in the list
1:31:14
it is empty we still do not get an error because in list API call we are not
1:31:20
requesting for a particular resource we are requesting a list list of the resource right a list of organizations
1:31:26
that is the reason we never send four or4 responses in list API calls a 404
1:31:33
response is usually sent when the client is sending a particular resource ID okay
1:31:40
a particular resource a single resource or a bunch of resource in different different
1:31:45
representations when the client request for a particular number of resources or a single resource that is the use case
1:31:52
when we should send a 404 but if it is a list API call and we don't have any data let's say the filter
1:31:58
does not match any data let's say in the params we pass a filter so we pass
1:32:05
status filter and here instead of active and archived we pass some uh random
1:32:11
value some random value and when we execute this we are getting data as an
1:32:18
empty array and total is zero page one total Pages zero this is the kind of response we get in a list API call this
1:32:25
response code is still 200 because it is a this is a list API call if you notice
1:32:31
this we are not requesting a particular organization a particular resource that
1:32:37
is the reason we should not throw 404 here even if we have no data for this
1:32:42
filter we do not say resource not found we say the data is empty this is a thumb
1:32:48
rule that you have to remember that if it's a list API call and there is no data you should return an empty array
1:32:54
with 200 response instead of returning 404 404 is only return When the client
1:33:00
is requesting for a particular entity which does not exist in the server okay with that we have covered all the CED
1:33:07
operations C basically means create read in the read we have get and list we have
1:33:13
update and we have delete cow operations we have covered all the crow operations and this is how the typical crowd
1:33:19
operations based API design interface will look like now what we have a custom
1:33:24
action by custom action I mean we want to perform some action on the server
1:33:31
which does not fall under any of these categories it is not a create operation it is not a get operation or an update
1:33:37
or a delete operation it is a particular action that we want to perform on a
1:33:43
single organization entry let's say this is organization five and we want to
1:33:48
Archive organization 5 okay now archiving an organization
1:33:54
you can on the first look you can imagine that if we update the status field of an organization to status
1:34:02
archived then it is archived right so ideally it should fall under patch right
1:34:09
but that is not the case you want to perform some action you want don't want
1:34:14
to update an entity even though at the end of the day it is updating the entity
1:34:19
uh you are updating organization five from status active to archived but at
1:34:24
the end of the day it is an custom action because let's say you want to Archive organization five right you want
1:34:32
to make the status from active to archived now this is the action that you
1:34:38
want to perform but you cannot simply just update the status field because when an organization is archived a lot
1:34:45
of operations will have to be performed maybe all the projects that resides
1:34:50
under that organization will also have to get get removed get deleted or some
1:34:55
kind of operation maybe the users that are involved in that organization have to be sent notifications or they have to
1:35:04
be sent emails right and all the tasks that fall under all the projects that
1:35:09
fall under all the organization they have to be deleted right lot of actions have to be performed from server side
1:35:16
when a particular organization is archived that is the reason updating the
1:35:21
status field of an organization from active to archived is not actually archiving an organization it at the end
1:35:28
of the day is an custom action you want to Archive an organization so now we
1:35:34
have a use case where we want to perform some kind of custom action in this case
1:35:41
the action is want to Archive a particular organization you want to
1:35:46
perform this custom action on the server side for a particular organization right now as I have mentioned before whenever
1:35:54
we have a use case which does not fall under any of the crud flows it is not a
1:36:00
create get delete or update method then we can use post with the custom action
1:36:07
to construct an API call to execute that custom action in the server set so let's
1:36:13
do that in the next API we'll create a new request and let's rename this to
1:36:20
Archive archive organization right and here from the name also you can see that
1:36:29
up until here we have crud endpoints we have delete get update create list right
1:36:34
from the names you can see that these are crud operations but at the end we have archive this is not a cud operation
1:36:42
that's why we are classifying it as a custom action okay now how do you
1:36:47
perform customer action we make it a post call we make it a post call then we
1:36:54
take uh let's say uh let's execute this let's remove this and the ID of
1:37:01
oranization 5 is this we take this ID let's paste this here and before that we need the servers address for that this
1:37:10
one is the address let's spacee this here and here we have the service address here there is the root path with
1:37:18
the organizations then we have passed which organization like we want to
1:37:25
Archive organization five that's why we are passing the ID of organization five
1:37:30
then at last we want to write the action that we want to perform so in this case
1:37:35
it is an archive operation this is an archive action we have written archive
1:37:41
now we have the route ready okay and if you notice here this completely follows
1:37:47
a hierarchical relationship that we had uh mentioned earlier we have the service
1:37:53
address so ignore this part from this path segment we can see that we have all organizations inside all organization we
1:38:00
have a single particular organization and for that organization we want to perform some action so it is a clear
1:38:07
hierarchical path that your API endpoint should ideally fall now when we execute
1:38:13
this we are getting a response and in the response we have the organization
1:38:18
five and the status is archived we have made organization five from status
1:38:24
active to status archived as a custom action with post end point right and
1:38:30
even though we have used post here we still got the Response Code as 200
1:38:35
that's the reason you should not blindly assume that every post call will have
1:38:40
the Response Code of 2011 which is the creator Response Code because there
1:38:46
could be also custom actions custom actions like these which will return 200
1:38:51
because they did not create any resource they will return 200 for custom API
1:38:56
calls for custom action based API calls okay now with that we have covered all
1:39:02
the API endpoints for the schema for the data model organizations okay now with
1:39:07
that we have covered all the API end points for organization this schema now
1:39:14
let's move on to projects right we will do this one more time uh so that you can
1:39:20
internalize all the patterns that we are using while while designing our endpoints all the patterns that we are
1:39:26
using while designing the interface of our API okay okay so now let's continue
1:39:35
designing all the apas for projects right projects endpoints so going back to
1:39:40
insomnia uh what I've done here I have created a folder called org and I've
1:39:46
moved all the organization based endpoints inside the org folder so that it's easier to manage now that we'll be
1:39:52
creating all the endpoints for projects this part is categorized as organization endpoints
1:39:59
now we can minimize this create another folder and we'll name this as project
1:40:04
and under this let's this let's create our first request which will be a post
1:40:12
request and this time we'll do this L still faster since I've already explained all the concepts behind it in
1:40:18
the previous endpoint creation flows so this time we'll just uh Focus Fus on the patterns but we'll move faster so we
1:40:27
have the servers address which is htdp Local Host and the port is
1:40:34
3,000 slash since we are designing now the endpoint for project that's why as
1:40:41
our pattern says the plural form of the resource in small case which gives us
1:40:48
projects okay now this is for the post AP call okay now this route is ready now
1:40:57
now what should go in the body since post request uh we are creating a new
1:41:02
project what should go in the body a Json payload in the Json payload we can
1:41:08
basically send name organization ID status description because the ID
1:41:14
created at and updated at are server handle fields we do not uh accept that
1:41:19
from the client payload we are only accepting name organization ID status and description so name will be some
1:41:26
project name then organization ID will be some organization ID that is already existing and the status will be let's
1:41:33
say planned and the description will be some kind of description okay so let's
1:41:38
come here and name is let's say project one then we have
1:41:46
organization id id is some random ID for
1:41:51
now let's not worry about that then we have status let's say it is planned and
1:41:59
in the end we have description the description we can pass some back okay
1:42:06
now we have the payload ready now another thing to notice here is any kind of Json payloads whether it is a Json uh
1:42:13
any kind of Json data whether it is a payload that we send from client to server or it is a response that we
1:42:20
receive from server to client it should always follow the fields should always
1:42:25
follow camel case right that is a common standard when it comes to Json so that
1:42:32
is something you have to keep in mind whether you are accepting payloads or you are giving responses from server
1:42:37
side always try to stick to Json standards if you are using Json as your calization format uh that way uh clients
1:42:46
do not have to do a lot of guess work because it is already established pattern that Json Fields always follow
1:42:53
camel case okay now let's hit this and we got a status 2011 because a new
1:43:01
project is created and we got all the um fields that we have passed and the
1:43:07
project entity that is created the typical create a using post let's go
1:43:12
ahead and let's create another request and it will be a let's rename this to
1:43:18
create project and we'll name this one to list project okay and this will be as
1:43:27
usual a get call and we can copy the route of the post call because as I've
1:43:33
already mentioned the routes of create a resource and list resource will most of
1:43:40
the time look similar and the routes of get a single resource update a single
1:43:46
resource and delete a single resource will most of the time look similar because of the semantic meaning that
1:43:53
comes with them right so we don't have to make any other changes here it is a
1:43:59
list call and when we send this the server senses all the projects that is
1:44:04
inside the database okay so in the create one we can create a few more
1:44:09
project two project 3 and in the list we can go
1:44:15
ahead and we can do different different parameters can pass limit as one right
1:44:23
if you pass limit is one we only get one response but when we add page with limit
1:44:30
and the page is two here we are getting project three but when we are sending
1:44:35
limit one and page two we'll ideally get project two because it is the next portion of the data that we are fetching
1:44:42
from the server similarly this will also have sorts this will also have filters that we have already discussed in the
1:44:48
previous endpoint while we are uh dealing with list organizations endo right we have create projects and we
1:44:55
have list projects now another thing I want to mention here is when you are designing apis uh for a particular
1:45:02
platform right as long as you are inside a single project so all the apis inside
1:45:09
that project does not matter what the resources are here we have two resources we have organization and we have project
1:45:16
but across different resources your query parameters and your Json payload
1:45:21
should look similar and what I mean by that is let's say in the create
1:45:27
organization if you see the body you can see the name uh the project has an
1:45:33
organization has name and it has description and we are expecting those fields from the client now similarly in
1:45:39
the create project also we have name and we also have description that we are expecting from the client now the point
1:45:46
I'm trying to make here is you should always try to be consistent when it comes to the Json payloads so so in the
1:45:54
create organization API you made description the key of description like this so in the create project API also
1:46:01
we have to uh you should keep the key similar you should not like go ahead and
1:46:08
DSC right this also expresses that this field is associated with the description
1:46:14
field but since you already have an API where the Json payload contains a
1:46:20
description field from that point on all all the apis that you design should follow a consistent pattern and if it's
1:46:27
a description field then you should only uh then you should try to match that you
1:46:33
should not try to rename Fields when the context is the same because because
1:46:40
usually what happens when a front end engineer when some kind of client right
1:46:46
they integrate your API they consume one API they integrate one API and from that
1:46:51
point on that frontend engineer that uh client they make a lot of assumptions of
1:46:58
how your API functions they make assumptions that let's say this is a create organization API right from this
1:47:05
point on when they want to integrate the project endpoints they will make a lot
1:47:11
of assumptions that the since the project also has a name field since the project also has a description field
1:47:17
this is what the payload will look like for a project and it did look like that because that's the way you have designed
1:47:23
it but imagine if you made the description field as
1:47:28
DSC and the client the front end engineer without looking at the docs without looking at the specs of your API
1:47:35
they executed the API right with the description field and they get a validation error now of course uh during
1:47:42
development these kind of these kinds of things happen and that's totally fine but the point is you should not waste um
1:47:50
the people who are integrating your AP you should not waste their time and you should not waste their effort you should
1:47:56
not make them do guess work right your API should always follow a consistent
1:48:02
pattern whether it comes to routes or whether it comes to payloads whether it comes to responses always follow
1:48:08
consistent pattern once you create an API stick to that standard whatever styling that you have followed stick to
1:48:15
that not make arbitrary decisions across different different resources for
1:48:20
different different end points right always be consistent that's one of the most important characteristic of a good
1:48:26
backend engineer the consistency of styling when it comes to API design
1:48:33
similarly for list for create organization here we followed this pattern where uh the route is
1:48:40
organizations the plural form of the resource now for the projects part let's say if we had did just project right now
1:48:48
the person who is integrating your API judging and assuming from your create
1:48:54
organization API they'll they'll assume that the create project API must also
1:49:00
follow the plural form right because that's what the organizations API followed so if you do not follow the
1:49:07
same style if you do not be consistent then they'll also get an error at that then they have to figure out they have
1:49:13
to read the specs they have to read the documentation etc etc right which is a lot of drag and that is the reason uh
1:49:20
that is the importance of sticking sticking to a particular style sticking to a global standard now let's move on
1:49:28
let's create the rest of the apis we also have a get API let's create the
1:49:34
rest of the apis we also have a get project API so what we can do copy this
1:49:41
let paste this we have projects and up to this point we have to pass the project ID because it is a single
1:49:49
project fetching API it is a get API which fetches a single projects that's why in the dynamic parameter you have to
1:49:55
pass the ID of the project now let's execute this uh list projects and list
1:50:02
this parameters and execute this let's copy some ID and in this let's rename
1:50:09
this one to project and let's paste this ID and when we execute this we got the
1:50:16
response for a single project right ideally uh with the Response Code of 200
1:50:22
similarly let's go ahead and create the update API let's rename this project
1:50:30
okay and here also we can let's copy the get project and here we can paste it as
1:50:37
I've already mentioned the routes of get single resource update single resource
1:50:42
and delete single resource will always look similar because of the semantic meaning that they represent behind the
1:50:48
scenes now this is an update API so will do patch because we are sending partial
1:50:54
Fields right and this will re require some kind of body so this what should we
1:51:00
update the description let's update the description we are say the description is the existing description is some
1:51:07
random value we'll change it so in the body we can send partial Fields so we
1:51:13
just need to send the value of the new description field and here we can say
1:51:18
that new description okay and when we send this we get a 20 when we send this
1:51:24
we got a 200 response because it is a patch request and we got the updated
1:51:29
entity and as you can see the description is new description yeah that's the typical behavior of patch
1:51:35
similarly let's implement the delete request this one inside project new
1:51:41
request and let's rename let's rename this to delete project okay and we can
1:51:49
just copy this because it is a single project API and we make this method as
1:51:56
delete and there will be no body Etc right and I can send this and as usual
1:52:04
since it is a delete method we got a 204 no content response and there is nothing
1:52:10
in the response because it is a delete request and at last we have a custom action so in case of project we have a
1:52:17
requirement that the client the front end can clone a particular project and
1:52:24
when they clone it what happens that project all the values of that project gets cloned and a new project with a
1:52:32
different ID is created in the database with that other operations might also get executed in the server side which we
1:52:39
don't know about that is the reason it is a custom action and it is not a
1:52:44
create action we could have also done that uh the client would also call the create project API and it could take all
1:52:52
the values from the existing project it could pass uh all of them in the payload and create a new project with the all
1:52:59
the same values it could simulate a cloning operation but but we don't know
1:53:05
what clone means on the server side right if project clone can also mean that we have to take all the tasks that
1:53:13
are inside that project and we have to also clone them right and maybe we have
1:53:19
to send an email to the owner of the project that your project have cloned ET right the server maybe has to perform a
1:53:27
lot of other operations when a project is cloned that is the reason we cannot simulate cloning operation using just a
1:53:34
create project API right we have to explicitly create an endo uh with a custom action for cloning
1:53:43
okay so let's go ahead and do that let's create a new one let's rename this clone
1:53:51
project and this will be post call as you already know all the custom actions which do not fall under any crud
1:53:57
operations are categorized under post because post is an open-ended method
1:54:02
when it comes to rest APS specification so let's copy this one because the route
1:54:09
will be similar we want to clone this particular project right let's paste this at the end we just write the name
1:54:15
of the action this is how we designed a custom action based API we have the
1:54:21
servers address we have the resource in the plural form we have the particular resource that we
1:54:28
want to perform the action on and at last the name of the action this is what the structure of the API looks like and
1:54:34
it does not have any payload uh for this use case but maybe you can take payloads
1:54:39
maybe you can take um some fields that the client wants to override for a clone operation okay now when we execute this
1:54:47
we get a project not found and 404 response because we already deleted this project so let's go ahead and pick up a
1:54:54
new project and replace this ID and then we execute this and we got it 20 one
1:55:02
response now as I said you cannot assume from the method that since this the post
1:55:08
method it will be a 20 1 response or since it is a custom action it cannot
1:55:15
return 2011 because depending on what happens on the server side the Response Code might change because during in
1:55:22
cloning the server creates a new project that's why the server returned a
1:55:28
response which says 2011 which means I created a new resource for you okay we got a 2011
1:55:34
response and the newly created resource and the name is Project to clone and all the fields that are similar to the
1:55:43
project 2 entry that we had next this is the custom action based API for projects
1:55:49
endpoint and with that all end points of project resource are completed hopefully
1:55:55
by now you are able to establish all the patterns that goes behind designing all these apis and if you were to design all
1:56:04
the apis for task so you would follow the same kind of pattern right you'll have a list API you'll have a get single
1:56:11
task API you'll have delete update and you'll have some kind of Uh custom action right the patterns are same does
1:56:17
not matter how many resources do you have the patterns still remain the same
1:56:23
with these patterns you can go out and design as many apis as you want right
1:56:28
the basics are the same the foundation is still the same now with that out of the way there are a couple of things
1:56:35
that you have to keep in mind while you are creating your apas to provide a good
1:56:41
experience to whoever is integrating your apas and whoever is maintaining your apas always try to provide an
1:56:48
interactive documentation for your apas uh for for example start integrating
1:56:54
Swagger tools like Swagger API which provide uh an interactive playground for
1:57:00
trying out your apas right start planning that from your initial planning
1:57:05
so that even so that you can use it to test your apas and whoever is integrating your apas they can use it as
1:57:12
a form of documentation and as a form of testing right that's the first thing
1:57:17
this is very important and one of the most important things that sets part as a backend engineer how consistently and
1:57:25
how frequently you uh create maintain and update your open API or Swagger
1:57:32
documentation second thing is make your apis intuitive and consistent which I've
1:57:38
already mentioned all your routes all the patterns when it comes to your
1:57:43
Dynamic parameters when you or custom actions or Json payloads all of them
1:57:48
should follow a single pattern so if your following the global pattern the
1:57:54
global standards of rest API then that's great right but even if you're not
1:57:59
following that for some reason for some random reason that I cannot understand even if you cannot follow it but follow
1:58:07
something right and stick to it do not change your styling do not change your
1:58:13
patterns of your API in different different end points across different different resources right that is a huge
1:58:21
pain point for or whoever is trying to integrate your apis keep the behavior keep the data format keep the naming
1:58:28
everything consistent and intuitive third provide CN defaults and by this I
1:58:33
mean uh as we saw in the pag generation API right even if the client does not pass a default page the server sets the
1:58:41
default page as one if the client does not pass a limit parameter the default
1:58:46
limit is 10 or 20 if the client does not part pass a sort field the default field
1:58:54
is created at if the sort order is not passed the default sort order is descending similarly for post calls
1:59:01
let's say there is a post operation in that case only require the amount of
1:59:07
information that you absolutely need to create that entity otherwise provide
1:59:12
some same defaults so even if it's a uh post call there are some fields for
1:59:18
example in our earlier create organization API there is a field for
1:59:23
status if you see here the organization has a field for status which can have
1:59:28
active or archived but judging from the business logic judging from common sense
1:59:35
right you can assume that when an organization is created by default it
1:59:41
should be in active state right so from the client if the client does not pass
1:59:46
the status field the server should by default set the status as active because
1:59:52
it is a same default that part you can assume and it is a safe assumption so
1:59:58
for feels like status you can take some
2:00:03
status entry which makes most sense for your use case and provide that as a same
2:00:09
default so that for creating an organization even if the client just passes name and a description and since
2:00:16
the description is optional here even if the client just passes a name this organization is is successfully created
2:00:23
with status active because on the server side you have provided same defaults that's what we mean by same defaults
2:00:30
both in get a calls in post a calls similarly always avoid abbreviations uh
2:00:36
like DEC for description etc etc right because the amount of information you
2:00:43
have while creating apis while creating the interface for your apas is not the same amount of information that the
2:00:50
people will have who are integrating your apis right so you cannot assume that if you provided some kind of
2:00:56
abbreviation or some kind of short form of a field the people will be able to
2:01:04
understand that and will be able to provide a appropriate entry for that
2:01:09
field and that is the reason keep your peels whether it is payloads or whether
2:01:14
it is query parameters keep them intuitive keep them readable and do not
2:01:21
use use abbreviations and stuff right now these are just a couple of things that you have to keep in mind while
2:01:27
designing your API interfaces and that is pretty much all that I have about API
2:01:33
designing uh hopefully it will help you uh make decisions make good decisions
2:01:39
make decisions faster and stick to a particular standards so that it is easier for people who are maintaining
2:01:45
your apis and it is easier for people who are integrating and consuming your apis in the future as a backend engineer
2:01:52
that's your responsibility to provide delightful to provide intuitive apis and
2:01:59
always remember that an API a rest API at least is designed in the initial form
2:02:05
it is not coded or it is not programmed right away at the first at the first
2:02:11
phase of the API creation it is designed you have to make a lot of decisions to design your apis you cannot
2:02:18
right away jump into programming that is the reason if you start uh with an open
2:02:24
API playground like Swagger or some kind of um API clients like insomnia or
2:02:30
Postman to design the interface for your apis it will provide you more insights
2:02:35
into how your clients or how the consumers of your apis are going to use
2:02:41
it and that will make you think and that will make you make your apis in a much
2:02:46
better way in a much more intuitive way and that is the reason before getting into
2:02:52
the coding part the programming of the API part regardless of the programming language that you're using whether it is
2:02:58
go whether it is notes or any other language you should dedicate a separate session a separate session for just
2:03:05
designing your interface the designing the interface for your apis without
